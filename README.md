# Subnet Stack


IPV4 subnetting is a very important factor not to ignore these days when it comes to networking. This is as a result of the limited availability of IPV4 addresses. 
Despite its importance, so many students starting off in this field find it very difficult to grab its concepts.
    Subnet Stack has been developed to address this problem. It provides useful features which enables students to easily understand the concepts of IPV4 addressing and subnetting.
Subnet Stacks main features are presented below:

### Main Features!

  - Uses robust algorithms to generate addressing plans of subnetworks for all address classes. It enables users to generate these addresses either with Fixed Length Subnet Mask or Variable Length Subnet Mask algorithms.
  - It equally provides multiple output formats (doc, pdf, xls) for the generated addresses which enables users to use the output in any editor of choice.
  - Subnet Stack also provides a beginner to Intermediate level lectures for IPV4 addressing and subnetting. Questions are provided after each lecture which enables its users to fully understand the lectures.
  - Subnet stack equally has a simple help/guide on how to use the software.
  

### What Subnet Stack does not support
  - It does not provide support for IPV6, only IPV4. This functionality might never be supported by Subnet Stack since the problem it addresses (subnetting due to shortage of IPV4 addresses) is already resolved in IPV6 (theoretically unlimited number of IP addresses hence no need for subnetting).


### How to run the software
Subnet Stack is a very light *.jar file* hence requires the **java runtime environment** to be installed. The recommended version to install is the latest update of **java 8**. You can get that from here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
Once you have it java installed, download the jar file from the repository and run it. Then Enjoy :)


**Subnet Stack is free and always will be. **
